#  Progress

I have an idea for a possible project for OSS, and that is an extensible bit-torrent client written in C and extensible throught Guile.
Because the project is most likely going to be very modular, I think it would be good to use a blessed repository and have anyone who want to contribute, fork the repo and merge in their changes.
However, this is just a thought for orginazation.
